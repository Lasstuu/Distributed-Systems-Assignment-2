**AI Declaration**

GitHub Copilot was used for debugging errors, brewing ideas for the implementation and with the syntax of xml2js (I haven't used it before).
No other AI tool was used.

**Installation**

First run on the root folder:
npm run preinstall
npm run install
npm install
npm run build
Then the application can be ran with:
npm run dev
